# Test Coverage Review Prompt

## MANDATORY: THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT TEST REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL THINKING REQUIRED**: Before reviewing tests:
1. Carefully determine if this is a bug fix - bug fixes MUST have tests, NO EXCEPTIONS
2. Think through what tests are needed to prevent regression
3. Consider all edge cases and failure scenarios
4. Verify that tests actually test the changed functionality
5. Ensure tests would catch the original bug if it reoccurred

**REMEMBER**: 
- Bug fixes without tests must be REJECTED immediately
- Tests should be specific, not generic
- Test names should clearly describe what they test
- Each test should have a clear purpose

Think step-by-step about test coverage. Missing tests are a critical failure.

This review evaluates test coverage and quality against established standards.

## Test Requirements

Tests are mandatory for:
- **Bug fixes**: Verification of fix and regression prevention
- **New features**: Functional validation and edge case coverage
- **Critical paths**: Business logic and data operations
- **Integration points**: API contracts and system boundaries

## What I'm Looking For

### Bug Fix Testing Standards

Bug fixes require:
1. **Reproduction test**: Demonstrates the original issue
2. **Fix verification**: Confirms the solution works
3. **Regression test**: Prevents future reoccurrence
4. **Edge case coverage**: Related scenarios that could fail

**Policy**: Bug fixes without tests will be rejected.

### For New Features

New features benefit from tests:
- **Happy path**: Does it work as intended?
- **Edge cases**: What about unusual inputs?
- **Error handling**: Does it fail gracefully?

### For Refactoring

If you're cleaning up code:
- Existing tests should still pass
- Consider adding tests if coverage is low
- Document any behavior changes

## Test Quality Standards

Required characteristics:
- **Clear naming**: Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern
- **Single responsibility**: One assertion per test
- **Performance**: Unit tests < 100ms, Integration < 1s
- **Deterministic**: Consistent results across runs
- **Maintainable**: Minimal coupling to implementation details

## Common Test Patterns I Like

### The AAA Pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
```
// Arrange - Set up your test data
var calculator = new Calculator();

// Act - Do the thing you're testing
var result = calculator.Add(2, 3);

// Assert - Check it worked
Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
```

### Test Naming That Makes Sense
```
MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior()
// Example: Add_TwoPositiveNumbers_ReturnsSum()
```

## When Test Infrastructure Exists

Existing test infrastructure must be utilized. This includes:
- Test projects in the solution
- Configured testing frameworks
- Established test patterns in the codebase
- Available mocking libraries

There are no acceptable exceptions when infrastructure is present.

## Enforcement Policy

**Tests are required, not optional:**
- Bug fixes without tests: **Rejected**
- New features without tests: **Changes requested**
- Refactoring that breaks tests: **Must fix before merge**
- Missing edge case coverage: **Major issue**

This policy ensures code reliability and prevents regression.
