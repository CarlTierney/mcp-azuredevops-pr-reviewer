# Unimplemented and Hardcoded Metrics Report

## Executive Summary
This report identifies metrics that are either unimplemented, using placeholder values, or incorrectly advertised as being generated by the Azure DevOps Repository Analyzer.

## 1. UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### 1.1 Security Analysis
- **Location**: `core/main_analyzer.py:116-119`
- **Status**: Completely unimplemented
- **Current Output**: "Security analysis not implemented in this version"
- **Called in**: Main analysis workflow (Step 3)

### 1.2 Knowledge Management Analysis  
- **Location**: `core/main_analyzer.py:121-124`
- **Status**: Completely unimplemented
- **Current Output**: "Knowledge management analysis not implemented in this version"
- **Called in**: Main analysis workflow (Step 3)

## 2. MISSING CSV OUTPUTS

The following CSV files are advertised in `run_analyzer.py` but are NOT actually generated:

### 2.1 azdo_team_collaboration_patterns.csv
- **Advertised as**: "Team collaboration analysis"
- **Status**: NO code found to generate this file
- **Search result**: No `to_csv` calls for this filename

### 2.2 azdo_enhanced_summary_report.csv
- **Advertised as**: "Consolidated summary"
- **Status**: NO code found to generate this file
- **Search result**: No `to_csv` calls for this filename
- **Note**: The `generate_analysis_summary()` method creates a dictionary but doesn't save it to CSV

## 3. ACTUAL CSV FILES GENERATED

The following CSV files are actually generated by the analyzer:

### Core Analysis Files (advertised and working):
1. **azdo_productivity_metrics.csv** - Generated by `productivity_analyzer.py`
2. **azdo_csharp_sql_quality_metrics.csv** - Generated by `code_quality_analyzer.py`
3. **azdo_commit_timing_metrics.csv** - Generated by `timing_analyzer.py`
4. **azdo_enhanced_quality_metrics.csv** - Generated by `quality_analyzer.py`
5. **azdo_advanced_developer_contributions.csv** - Generated by `contribution_analyzer.py`
6. **azdo_repository_health_trends.csv** - Generated by `health_trends_analyzer.py`
7. **azdo_file_hotspots_analysis.csv** - Generated by `hotspot_analyzer.py`
8. **azdo_bus_factor_analysis.csv** - Generated by `hotspot_analyzer.py`

### Additional Files (not advertised but generated):
1. **azdo_developer_activity.csv** - Generated by `developer_analyzer.py`
2. **azdo_pull_request_metrics.csv** - Generated by `developer_analyzer.py`
3. **azdo_contribution_metrics.csv** - Generated by `contribution_analyzer.py`
4. **azdo_language_complexity.csv** - Generated by `language_analyzer.py`
5. **azdo_monthly_quality_metrics.csv** - Generated by `quality_analyzer.py`
6. **azdo_monthly_team_metrics.csv** - Generated by `quality_analyzer.py`
7. **azdo_enhanced_monthly_quality_metrics.csv** - Generated by `quality_analyzer.py`

## 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Remove False Advertising**: Update `run_analyzer.py` and all related files to remove references to:
   - `azdo_team_collaboration_patterns.csv`
   - `azdo_enhanced_summary_report.csv`

2. **Implement or Remove**: Either implement the following features or remove their calls:
   - Security Analysis (`analyze_security_insights`)
   - Knowledge Management Analysis (`analyze_knowledge_management`)

3. **Add Missing Outputs**: Update the output list to include the actual files being generated:
   - `azdo_developer_activity.csv`
   - `azdo_pull_request_metrics.csv`
   - `azdo_contribution_metrics.csv`
   - `azdo_language_complexity.csv`

### Implementation Priority:

1. **High Priority**: Fix the summary report generation
   - The `generate_analysis_summary()` method creates data but doesn't save it
   - Should save to `azdo_enhanced_summary_report.csv`

2. **Medium Priority**: Implement team collaboration patterns
   - Data exists in the system to generate collaboration metrics
   - Could analyze co-authorship, PR reviews, and file overlap

3. **Low Priority**: Security and Knowledge Management
   - These require significant new analysis logic
   - Could be moved to a future version

## 5. CODE LOCATIONS FOR FIXES

### Files that need updating:
- `run_analyzer.py` (lines 82-91)
- `run_analyzer_logged.py` (lines 130-139)
- `run_analyzer_with_logging.py` (lines 149-158)
- `run_analyzer_clean.py` (lines 78-87)
- `run_analyzer_no_emoji.py` (lines 73-82)

### Method that needs completion:
- `core/main_analyzer.py:generate_analysis_summary()` - Should save the summary_data to CSV

## 6. VALIDATION CHECKS

No hardcoded limit issues were found in the current version. The previous 90-day recency limit in the hotspot analyzer has been addressed.

## CONCLUSION

The analyzer is functional and produces valuable metrics, but there are discrepancies between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. The most critical issue is the false advertising of two CSV files that are never generated. Additionally, two analysis methods are called but only print placeholder messages.

To maintain code quality and user trust, these issues should be addressed by either:
1. Implementing the missing features
2. Removing references to unimplemented features
3. Updating documentation to accurately reflect current capabilities
