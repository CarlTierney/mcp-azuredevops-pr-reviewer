## Analysis Results

### ‚úÖ What's Good:
1. **Focused Change**: Only 1 file modified (Questionnaires.cs)
2. **Clear Purpose**: Fixes invite deletion functionality
3. **Linked to Work Item**: Connected to story #21156

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Missing Tests (HIGH RISK)**
- Author explicitly states "It doesn't have Integration Tests"
- This is a hotfix for a business logic component
- Risk of regression without test coverage

#### 2. **Low Review Participation**
- Only 1 of 4 reviewers has voted (Carl rejected it)
- Two required reviewers haven't reviewed yet
- Review depth score is very low (16/100)

#### 3. **Previous Rejection**
- Carl Tierney (required reviewer) already rejected the PR with vote -10
- Rejection reasons should be addressed before proceeding

## Recommendations

1. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Even for hotfixes, tests are crucial
   - Add tests for the invite deletion scenario
   - Verify edge cases are covered

2. **Address Rejection Concerns**
   - Respond to Carl's rejection feedback
   - Make necessary changes based on review comments

3. **Get Required Reviews**
   - Follow up with Iosif Petre (required reviewer)
   - Ensure both required reviewers approve before merge

## üî¥ Review Decision: **REQUEST CHANGES**

### Reasons:
1. **No tests for a business logic change** - This is unacceptable for production code
2. **Already rejected by a required reviewer** - Issues must be addressed
3. **Insufficient review coverage** - Only 25% participation

### Required Actions Before Approval:
1. ‚úÖ Add integration tests for the invite deletion fix
2. ‚úÖ Address the concerns that led to Carl's rejection
3. ‚úÖ Get approval from both required reviewers (Carl and Iosif)
4. ‚úÖ Resolve all 8 open discussion threads

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Integration tests added
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Code follows standards
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Logging added where appropriate
- [ ] Performance impact considered
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Summary
This is a straightforward fix affecting only the Questionnaires.cs file, but it lacks the necessary test coverage for a production hotfix. The PR has already been rejected by one required reviewer and needs both test coverage and review issues addressed before it can be approved.
